The original mission statement is:
Dell’s mission is to be the most successful computer company in the world at delivering the best customer experience in markets we serve.

I have revised the statment fifth times and ultimately get the new mission statement:
Dell’s mission is to be the leader of computer companies at developing electronic products and delivering the best customer experience in industry.

While doing the merge, I chose to use the new mission statement which I have revised.
